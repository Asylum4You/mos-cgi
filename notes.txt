In /etc/sudoers:

wwwdata    ALL=(ALL) /usr/local/bin/allowed-operation

And then in the script:

sudo /usr/local/bin/allowed-operation

OR

%www-data ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/service SERVICENAME *

or

%www-data ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/service SERVICENAME stop, /usr/sbin/service SERVICENAME start, /usr/sbin/service SERVICENAME restart
